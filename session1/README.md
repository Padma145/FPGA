# 1. Full Adder 
This project implements a full adder in Verilog HDL on an FPGA, implemented using Xilinx Vivado, is a combinational circuit that adds three 1-bit inputs: A, B, and Cin (carry-in). It generates two outputs: S (sum) and Cout (carry-out). The design is typically described in Verilog and then synthesized and implemented in the FPGA using Xilinx Vivado, ensuring accurate logic synthesis and hardware mapping. This project serves as a foundational step toward more complex digital systems.
